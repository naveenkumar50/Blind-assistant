**🚦 Blind Object Detection – AI Assistant for the Visually Impaired**

An intelligent computer vision tool that detects objects in real-time and provides audio feedback for visually impaired users. Built with Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyQt5, and pyttsx3 for voice output.

**⚙️ Key Features**

🎙️ Voice Feedback – Announces detected objects for blind users

📸 Real-Time Object Detection – Uses SSD MobileNet v3 model to detect common objects instantly

🏠 Indoor & Outdoor Modes – Optimized detection for different environments

🖥️ GUI Interface – Simple and interactive PyQt5 interface

**🧰 Tech Stack**

- Python 3.8+
- Computer Vision: TensorFlow, OpenCV
- GUI: PyQt5
- Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3
- Data Handling: Numpy, Pillow

**⚡ Impact**

🔄 Provides real-time object recognition

🤖 Reduces dependency on others for daily navigation

🎯 Enhances independence and safety for visually impaired users

**🧠 How It Works**

1. Load the GUI (`page1.py`) and select Indoor or Outdoor mode  
2. The system accesses the camera or image input  
3. SSD MobileNet v3 detects objects in real-time  
4. `pyttsx3` converts detected object names to speech
